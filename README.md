### LinkedIn Analytics (16 Tools)
- **Profile Analytics**: Personal and company profile data with engagement metrics
- **Content Analytics**: Posts, comments, reactions, and engagement analysis
- **Network Analytics**: Company posts, job market insights, and search capabilities
- **Performance Tracking**: Profile reactions, post reposts, and interaction patterns

### Facebook Analytics
- **Profile Intelligence**: Public profile data with follower insights
- **Engagement Metrics**: Activity patterns and audience interaction data
- **Content Analysis**: Profile engagement and reach analytics

### Instagram Analytics
- **Profile Performance**: Comprehensive profile data with follower demographics
- **Growth Analytics**: Follower count trends and engagement rates
- **Content Insights**: Profile activity and audience interaction patterns

### Web Intelligence

## Installation

### Step 1: Adding MCP to your Python project

If you haven't created a uv-managed project yet, create one:

```bash
uv init custom-mcp-server

```

### Step 2: Install MCP Dependencies

Then add MCP to your project dependencies:

```bash
uv add "mcp[cli]"
```
This will auto-generate files and folders similar to the project structure mentioned below, also create a .env file to securely store the API keys.

### Step 3: Add Project Code

In the files generated look for main.py and copy paste the code given in main.py (repo).

### Step 4: Install Additional Dependencies

```bash
uv add httpx python-dotenv fastmcp
```

- End all Claude-related processes

#### Step 2: Reinstall the Server
```bash
uv run mcp install main.py
```

#### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop
Paste the URLs of required platform and ask the AI to provide information of the mentioned URLs.

### Analytics Data Collection Issues

#### Rate Limiting
If you encounter rate limiting errors:
- Wait 60 seconds between requests for the same platform
- Use different API endpoints to distribute load
- Consider upgrading RapidAPI subscription for higher limits

#### Incomplete Data Returns
For missing analytics data:
- Verify profile/page is public and accessible
- Check if account has privacy restrictions
- Some metrics may require business/creator account access

#### Facebook/Instagram Access Issues
- Ensure profiles are public business pages
- Personal profiles may have limited data availability
- Some engagement metrics require page admin access

#### LinkedIn Premium Data
- Advanced analytics may require LinkedIn Premium URLs
- Company data depends on public visibility settings
- Employee lists limited by company privacy settings

### Testing with MCP Inspector

For development and debugging:

```bash
uv run mcp dev main.py
```

### API Key Validation

Test your API keys independently:

```bash
# Test RapidAPI connection
curl -H "x-rapidapi-key: YOUR_KEY" \
     -H "x-rapidapi-host: linkedin-scraper-api-real-time-fast-affordable.p.rapidapi.com" \
     "https://linkedin-scraper-api-real-time-fast-affordable.p.rapidapi.com/profile/detail?username=test"

# Test Serper API
curl -X POST "https://google.serper.dev/search" \
     -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_SERPER_KEY" \
     -d '{"q":"test query"}'
```

## Context Window Optimization

To prevent MCP context window overload, this server implements intelligent data filtering:

### Response Size Controls
- **LinkedIn Profiles**: Limited to ~6KB of essential data (name, title, connections, current role)
- **LinkedIn Posts**: Maximum 5 posts per request, ~5KB limit with key engagement metrics
- **Facebook/Instagram**: Limited to ~4KB focusing on follower counts and engagement rates
- **Search Results**: Maximum 8 results per query with truncated content

### Data Filtering Strategy
- **Excluded Fields**: Profile images, media URLs, full work histories, nested user objects
- **Text Truncation**: Long descriptions limited to 300-500 characters
- **List Limits**: Maximum 10 items in any array (comments, posts, connections)
- **Essential Focus**: Only analytics-relevant metrics and engagement data retained

### Customization
Modify response limits in `main.py`:
```python
RESPONSE_LIMITS = {
    "linkedin_profile": 6000,    # Characters
    "linkedin_posts": 5000,      # Characters  
    "max_posts_returned": 5,     # Number of posts
    "max_comments_returned": 10  # Number of comments
}
```
